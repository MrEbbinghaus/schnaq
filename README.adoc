= Dev Setup

The dev-Setup has different parts for Backend and frontend.

== Backend

1. Install https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka].
2. Datomic in Memory database is needed.
Execute `bb run.clj` to start datomic in memory database.
3. Either start a normal REPL or the preconfigured Backend-Server + REPL.
4. If you want to start the server standalone use `clj -A:run-server`.

== Frontend

The Frontend works with shadow-cljs for hot code reload.

1. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to get javascript dependencies.
2. Run `npx shadow-cljs watch app` to compile the cljs and start the watcher.
3. Shadow-cljs starts a nrepl-server.
You can connect to localhost and the port output to the `.shadow-cljs/nrepl.port` file.
4. In the opened *CLJ* REPL you can execute `(shadow/repl :app)` to switch to the hot development REPL for *CLJS*.
